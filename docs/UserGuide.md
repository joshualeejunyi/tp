```
program /assign <WORKOUT_PLAN_NAME [string]> /to <DAY [string]>
```

2. Tuesday / Tues / Tue
3. Wednesday / Wed
4. Thursday / Thurs / Thu
5. Friday / Fri
6. Saturday / Sat

### Remove a workout plan for a day
You can also remove a workout plan from a given day of the week by using the `/clear` flag.
```
program /clear <DAY [string]>
```
As stated, the DAY parameter must follow the format above.

Example of usage: 
```
program /clear Tuesday
```

Expected outcome:
```
[BYTE-CEPS]> Your workout on Tuesday has been cleared
```

## Logging Workouts
You are also able to log the amount of weight, sets and repetitions you have completed for an exercise on a given day, through the logging functionality. 

In order to log your exercises, must first have a workout plan assigned to the day that you are logging. However, you may log an exercise that was not originally in the workout plan to allow for flexibility of programs but you must create the exercise first.

### Adding an exercise log
You may create a workout log using the `/log` flag in the program command.

```
program /log <EXERCISE_NAME [string]> /weight <WEIGHT [integer]> /sets <NUMBER_OF_SETS [integer]> /reps <NUMBER_OF_REPS [integer]>
```

Example of usage: 
```
program /log benchpress /weight 125 /sets 3 /reps 5
```

Expected outcome:
```
[BYTE-CEPS]> Successfully logged 125kg benchpress with 3 sets and 5 reps on 2024-03-28
```

### Adding an exercise log for a separate date
You may also create a workout log for a specified date.
```
program /log <EXERCISE_NAME [string]> /weight <WEIGHT [integer]> /sets <NUMBER_OF_SETS [integer]> /reps <NUMBER_OF_REPS [integer]> /date <DATE [yyyy-mm-dd]>
```

Example of usage: 
```
program /log benchpress /weight 125 /sets 3 /reps 5 /date 2024-03-25
```

Expected outcome:
```
[BYTE-CEPS]> Successfully logged 125kg benchpress with 3 sets and 5 reps on 2024-03-25
```

### Viewing logs
You may see all the dates that you have entered at least a log entry by using the `/history` flag in the program command. 
```
program /history
```

Example of usage:
```
program /history
```

Expected outcome:
```
[BYTE-CEPS]> Listing Workout Logs:
			1. 2024-03-27
			2. 2024-03-06
			3. 2024-03-28
			4. 2024-03-25
```

### Viewing historic logs
You may view the logs that you have added on a given date by specifying a date in the `/history` flag.
```
program /history <DATE [yyyy-mm-dd]>
```

Example of usage:
```
program /history 2024-03-27
```

Expected outcome:
```
[BYTE-CEPS]> Listing Exercises on 2024-03-27:
			1. barbell squat (weight: 70, sets: 3, reps: 5)
			2. leg extensions (weight: 55, sets: 3, reps: 15)
```
## Help Menu
You are able to access an in-program help menu that provides you with command formats for all of ByteCeps's functionality.

### Accessing Help Menu
ByteCeps provides the command format to access the help menu upon initial program execution:
```
[BYTE-CEPS]> To access the help menu for command guidance, please type:
help /COMMAND_TYPE_FLAG
Available command types (type exactly as shown):
exercise
workout
program
```

Command formats are shown according to 3 separate categories: `exercise`, `workout` & `program`

### Displaying Help Menu Category: Exercise

			 (1) assign a workout plan to a specific day of the week
			 (2) view today's workout plan
			 (3) see all workout plans assigned to each day of the week
			 (4) remove a workout plan from a given day of the week

[BYTE-CEPS]> program /history
```

## Exiting program
You may exit the program using the `exit` command.
```
exit
```

Example of usage: 
```
exit
```

Expected outcome:
```
[BYTE-CEPS]> All your workouts and exercises have been saved.
-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------
GOODBYE FOR NOW. STAY HARD!
-------------------------------------------------
```

## Saving the data
BYTE-CEPS data are saved in the hard disk automatically after the `exit` command . There is no need to save manually.

## Editing the data
BYTE-CEPS data are saved automatically as a JSON file `data.json` in the same directory as the Jar File. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

> Caution: If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, BYTE-CEPS will save the current data file as `data.json.old_YYYY_MMDD_HHSS_MM` and start with an empty data file at the next run.
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the BYTE-CEPS to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a date entered is of a different format). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
